# PerWorldInventory
A full featured per world inventory plugin.

This plugin allows you to share the inventories of multiple worlds by configuring it in the `config.yml` file. You can stop players from switching inventories per world by giving them the permission: `per-world-inventory.bypass`.

### Installation
It is mostly recommended to use released versions of the plugin, which can be found in the released version on Poggit. (once there is one)<br>
If you do decide you want the latest version of the plugin, it is recommended you fetch a pre-compiled phar file from Poggit-CI, which can be found below.
