# Configuration file for PerWorldInventory by BlockHorizons

# Worlds in which inventories should be bundled.
#
# The example below bundles hub1, hub2 and hub3 into one category
# labelled "hubs". Players will share the same inventory in all
# three worlds (hub1, hub2, hub3).
#
# Bundled-Worlds:
#   hubs:
#     - hub1
#     - hub2
#     - hub3
#
# If you don't want to bundle any worlds, set the value to an empty
# array like so:
# Bundled-Worlds: []
#
Bundled-Worlds:
  PlotWorlds:
    - plot1
    - plot2

# Database config
database:
  # The database type. "sqlite", "mysql" and "memory" are supported.
  type: sqlite

  # Edit these settings only if you choose "sqlite".
  sqlite:
    # The file name of the database in the plugin data folder.
    # You can also put an absolute path here.
    file: data.sqlite
  # Edit these settings only if you choose "mysql".
  mysql:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    # Avoid using the "root" user for security reasons.
    username: root
    password: ""
    schema: your_schema
  memory:
    # Whether to delete inventories when player leaves the server.
    # Warning: If this is set to false, the inventories will stay
    # in memory until the server shuts down.
    delete-on-quit: true
  # The maximum number of simultaneous SQL queries
  # Recommended: 1 for sqlite, 2 for MySQL. You may want to further increase this value if your MySQL connection is very slow.
